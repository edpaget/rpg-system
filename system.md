##Introduction

The premise of [name of system] is to be flexible generic Role-Playing system, that emphasizes the storytelling aspect of table-top games. Its other important design goal is to produce Player Characters that are flawed in some way, while making it easy for players to create consistent characterizations.

##Basic Mechanic

[name of system]’s only dice roll is of two six sided die, usually with the goal to roll higher than the number 7. The number to beat can be modified by the Story Leader to reflect the difficulty of what a character is attempting, and aspects of the Player Character can give them bonuses or minuses.

##Normal Distributions

The purpose of rolling two six sided die as the game mechanic is to obtain a standard deviation of dice rolls, and the player is encourage to remember this concept throughout the game.

##Player Character Aspects

The General Mental and Phsyical Makeup of a character is reflexed by three main statistics. Each statistic represents the number of standard deviations from the mean a Character is in that area.

As an example, if a player had a  Intelligence statistic (explained below) of +2 that would mean he or she is two standard deviations from the mean intelligence of the game’s world.  Likewise a player character with -1 Constitution would be one standard deviation less strong or athletic than the mean population.

During character creation, a player is given a +2, 2x+1, and a -1, to distribute amongst their character’s statistics. (Described Further in player creation).

###Primary Aspects

Intelligence - Fairly self explanatory, it represents how smart a character is. In conjunction with Moxie it represents a character's ability to persuade others and with Strength it represents a character’s Dexterity.

Moxie - A character’s creativity and ability to improvise in a situation. Along with Intelligence it contributes to a character’s persuade ability, and with strength it is a part of a character’s tactical ability.

Strength - Obviously, how strong a character is, but also more generally a character’s kinesthetic intelligence, and athletic ability.. With Moxie is it a character’s tactics, and, with intelligence, is a character’s dexterity.

###Secondary Aspects:

Dexterity: Represented as Strength + Intelligence, it is a character’s nimbleness and speed, as well as their ability at things that required fine motor control like lock picking.

Tactics: Represented as Moxie + Strength, the tactics statistic represents a character to improvise in combat situations. As well as helping with the ability to guess what’s coming next.

Persuade: Represented as Intelligence + Moxie, it is a character’s ability to convince others generally, and more specifically can be tied to other skills like bluffing and haggling.

##Body Points, Sanity Points, and Power Points

Respectively, they represent a character’s physical Health and Mental Health.

Body Points(BP) may only be between 10 and -5. Being at -5BP would mean a character is unconscious and losing an more would result in player character death. At each level a player character may add +2BP to their score, but may never exceed the 10BP ceiling.

Sanity Points(SP) are unlimited and may go as low as high as a player wants. They reflect a character’s state of mind, and it is highly important for players to keep their character’s sanity point rating in mind while they role-play the character.

Power Points(PP) are limited to a set number per day (or other time period as decided by the story leader) based on the the character’s level. They are primarily consumed to to use character powers (described below), but also can be freely converted to/from sanity and body points.

##Skills

Skills are very specific things a character is good at. At the beginning of a game a player will make up two skills for their character to have, and the character will receive one skill ever three levels after that.

Skills should be for things like: Lock Picking, Computer Cracking, Dancing, Playing Saxophone, etc, and when the character attempts an action the player receives a +1 bonus to at to their roll. The Story Leader should ask players who choose skills that are overly broad to redefine them. Player's should also say which primary or secondary aspect their skill is related to. 

##Character Powers:

Are specific abilities special to the setting you are playing in. You receive one at the start of the game, and one each level after that.

##Character Creation:
Print the [character sheet](#). Fill out your character's basic information. If your setting using races and alignment, make sure to follow the setting's directions for them. 

You should first fill out your character's primary aspects, Intelligence, Moxie, and Strength. All of those aspects start out as 0. You have a combination of one +2 raise, two +1 raises, and one -1 subtraction to apply among the primary aspects. 

Once you've determined your primary aspects fill in your secondary aspects which as based on sums of your primary ones. 

* Dexterity = Intelligence + Strength
* Persuade = Intelligence + Moxie
* Tactics = Moxie + Strength

Then you can fill out your Body Points, Sanity Points, and Power Points. You have 5 points to distribute between BP and SP, and you recieve 2PP at the first level. 

Next select two skills for your player. and finally select one character power.

##Gameplay
[name of system] encourages players to view the game as an interactive story that is affected at intervals by randomness. Gameplay described here should only be viewed as a generic guideline for how to use [name of system] in your RPG. 

Generally there should be one Story Leader, who describes the setting, voices Non-Player Characters, and resolves disputes. The Story Leader is absolute final authority exceeding this rulebook. There can of course be more than one Story Leader.

Players should only have a single Player Character they roleplay as.

Gameplay has two distinct phases:

###Freeform Role Playing
Play enfolds with the Story Leader describing the setting and the players taking turns in any order interacting with each other. Dice should only be rolled when a Player Character attempts something requiring skill. When two Characters take opposing actions, or whenever the the Story Leader feels it should, the games moves into...

###Encounter Role Playing
Any encouter generally happens when two Characters attempt to take opposing actions
