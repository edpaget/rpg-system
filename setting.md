#The World of Elo - A setting for [rpg system name]

##Background
Elo is a planet pretty similar to Earth except that it has magic. Or well sometype of super/supra-natural force that people attuned to it can use. For the first sessession we'll be playing in Bronze Age Abre, and there will be a choice of three starting locations for the party. 

### Finjara
Built at the mouth of the Great Harbor of Finjara, with the white peaks of the Wyrm Mnts rising behind it, Finjara is the great city of the north. While normally too cold and dry for much of the year, hot springs and an intricate hydroponics system have allowed its inhabitants to flourish in the Taiga. 

The Finjarese are a strongly maritime people and are great weather workers. 

### Mycae
The Island of Mycae is situated in the middle of the In Most Sea and has a tropical climate. Wild fruits and game provide much of the sustance of its population although small scale agriculture imported from Alcemid has recently started to develop. 

The Mycae are fiercely proud warriors and often paint themselves before battle. They have a reputation for skilled healers so their people often go into battle entirely naked confident that their healers are better than any armor. 

### Alcemid
By far the largest city of the age, Alcemid is a sprawling metropolis along the delta of the Tahiri River. Already the city has been continuously inhabited for a thousand years, and its strict theocractic government runs the massive agricultural projects that sustain it with ruthless effiency. 

The Alcemid are a highly devout people, who value education and learning above all. They have built fantastical mechanical contraptions for directing the yearly floods of the Tahiri river away form the city, but they depend on a massive enslaved population to maintain and power them.
